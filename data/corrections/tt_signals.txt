Hi Amitav,

I am running 2DAlphabet using a fork from Fabio Iemmi for our ttbar analysis. Everything is working very well, thank you so much for the organized code and clear instructions. I have a few questions about the output - the plots_fit_s look good, but the plots_fit_b have huge uncertainties for the QCD background, which seems to be almost zero. What is the difference between the plots_fit_s and plots_fit_b?

One other thing I would like to do is include separate histograms for our analysis categories separated by btag and rapidity cuts. Is there a way to define the histogram in the json file, for example MttvsMt$region$systup can be MttvsMt$analysisCategory$region$systup.

Thank you so much for your help!
